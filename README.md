# Google Photos Plus
A chrome extension that allows you to download photos from [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com) in better quality than the default download option.


## Why this exists?
If you are an android user, chances are you are using Google Photos app to backup your photos to cloud. Google Photos is a great application and provides high qualtiy unlimited free storage for your photos.
I was going through the web version (https://photos.google.com) and realized that even though they store our photos in slightly better quality, when you click download they don't serve the highest quality possible for a photo.

This extension adds a new button on each photo which allows us to download the photo in best possible quality as shown below.
